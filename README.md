A repository for the application of machine learning to a memory data set. This is part of the MSc05 module of the [Psychology Master program](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/48331594/Willkommen_auf_den_Seiten_des_Instituts_f%C3%BCr_Psychologie?legacy_request=1) of [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?), specifically the cognition major/concentration which occurs within the [neurocognitive psychology lab](http://www.fiebachlab.org/).


## Overview

The goal is to apply a supervised, classification based machine learning algorithm to a memory data set. Speficiallly, a [data set from Wanja et al. (2021)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003707/versions/1.0.0) will be used.
