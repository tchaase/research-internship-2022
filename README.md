A repository for the application of machine learning to a memory data set. This is part of the MSc05 module of the [psychology master program](https://www.psychologie.uni-frankfurt.de/48331594/Willkommen_auf_den_Seiten_des_Instituts_f%C3%BCr_Psychologie?legacy_request=1) of [Goethe-University Frankfurt](https://www.uni-frankfurt.de/de?), specifically the cognition major/concentration which occurs within the [Fiebach lab](http://www.fiebachlab.org/).


## Overview

The goal is to apply a supervised, classification based machine learning model to a memory data set. Speficiallly, a data set from [Wanja et al. (2021)](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds003707/versions/1.0.0) that is available on OpenNeuro will be used. 

### Structure and content

The "content folder" includes all the information! Inside there, any descriptions of the purpose of the project will be within the folder "markdown". 
The "code" folder contains all the code, for now this includes only the data exploration and the linear model. 
The "open lab folder" contains documentation of this project and the progress of the project. 
Within the "data" folder, all the relevant data for this project is stored.
