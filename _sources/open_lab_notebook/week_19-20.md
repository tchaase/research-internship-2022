# Week 14 (Feburary 27th, 2023)

## goals for this time frame
- Get the z-maps for all runs for all participants that have their full data preprocessed
- Start the jupyter-book and write the introduction & search more literature for it. 


## work conducted for this time frame
- I managed to get all the z-maps, although this did lead to several crashes of the notebook. In the end one solution was to change some device settings and close everything else.
- I started the jupyter book and made progress with writing the introduction. However, I did not manage to progress the analyses further. 


## problems encountered during this time frame
- Several memory issues occured. I cannot run multiple participants in quick succession. 

Regarding the jupyter book several problems came up:

- I spend a few hours trying to figure out how to use citation via [sphinxcontrib-bibtex](https://sphinxcontrib-bibtex.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and in the end a simple intendation error was hard to track down that caused the citations to not appear as I intended them to appear. 
- I had several issues with the environment and the requirements. I solved this by specifying less packages and by not specifiying the required version.
