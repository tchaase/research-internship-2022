    "    * I also manually added an `anat` tag to the unpreprocessed images, in order to be able to specify that I am referring to the not preprocessed data.\n",

    "1. Brainlife probably does not expect me to want to analyze the data on my own. When downloading the data, the data is no longer in the BIDS formate. Reformatting the data took a lot of time and movement of files. \n",
    "2. Brainlife did not provide group-level outputs for MRI-QC. As a newbie in cognitive neuroscience, interpreting the quality measures without reference of the other subjects is tedious. But one has to mention again, that I would not have access to the data quality metrics if it weren't for brainlife! "
