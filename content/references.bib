	abstract = {Finding objective and effective thresholds for voxelwise statistics derived from neuroimaging data has been a long-standing problem. With at least one test performed for every voxel in an image, some correction of the thresholds is needed to control the error rates, but standard procedures for multiple hypothesis testing (e.g., Bonferroni) tend to not be sensitive enough to be useful in this context. This paper introduces to the neuroscience literature statistical procedures for controlling the false discovery rate (FDR). Recent theoretical work in statistics suggests that FDR-controlling procedures will be effective for the analysis of neuroimaging data. These procedures operate simultaneously on all voxelwise test statistics to determine which tests should be considered statistically significant. The innovation of the procedures is that they control the expected proportion of the rejected hypotheses that are falsely rejected. We demonstrate this approach using both simulations and functional magnetic resonance imaging data from two simple experiments.},

	abstract = {Remapping refers to a decorrelation of hippocampal representations of similar spatial environments. While it has been speculated that remapping may contribute to the resolution of episodic memory interference in humans, direct evidence is surprisingly limited. We tested this idea using high-resolution, pattern-based fMRI analyses. Here we show that activity patterns in human CA3/dentate gyrus exhibit an abrupt, temporally-specific decorrelation of highly similar memory representations that is precisely coupled with behavioral expressions of successful learning. The magnitude of this learning-related decorrelation was predicted by the amount of pattern overlap during initial stages of learning, with greater initial overlap leading to stronger decorrelation. Finally, we show that remapped activity patterns carry relatively more information about learned episodic associations compared to competing associations, further validating the learning-related significance of remapping. Collectively, these findings establish a critical link between hippocampal remapping and episodic memory interference and provide insight into why remapping occurs.},

	abstract = {I argue that our current practice of ascribing the term ‘memory’ to mental states and processes lacks epistemic warrant. Memory, according to the ‘received view’, is any state or process that results from the sequential stages of encoding, storage, and retrieval. By these criteria, memory, or its footprint, can be seen in virtually every mental state we are capable of having. This, I argue, stretches the term to the breaking point. I draw on phenomenological, historical, and conceptual considerations to make the case that an act of memory entails a direct, non-inferential feeling of reacquaintance with one's past. It does so by linking content retrieved from storage with autonoetic awareness during retrieval. On this view, memory is not the content of experience, but the manner in which that content is experienced. I discuss some theoretical and practical implications and advantages of adopting this more circumscribed view of memory.

The notion of episodic memory was first proposed some 30 years ago. At that time it was defined in terms of materials and tasks. It was subsequently refined and elaborated in terms of ideas such as self, subjective time, and autonoetic consciousness. This chapter provides a brief history of the concept of episodic memory, describes how it has changed (indeed greatly changed) since its inception, considers criticisms of it, and then discusses supporting evidence provided by (a) neuropsychological studies of patterns of memory impairment caused by brain damage, and (b) functional neuroimaging studies of patterns of brain activity of normal subjects engaged in various memory tasks. I also suggest that episodic memory is a true, even if as yet generally unappreciated, marvel of nature.},

However, recent neuropsychological studies in nonhuman primates have indicated that other regions within the medial temporal lobe, specifically, structures in the parahippocampal region, are primarily responsible for object recognition and object identification. This article reviews the behavioral effects of removal of structures within the parahippocampal region in monkeys, and cites relevant work in rodents as well. It is argued that the perirhinal cortex, in particular, contributes to object identification in at least two ways: (i) by serving as the final stage in the ventral visual cortical pathway that represents stimulus features, and (ii) by operating as part of a network for associating together sensory inputs within and across sensory modalities.},

Additional direct sources of afferent input to the entorhinal cortex were found to originate in Brodmann's areas 51, 49 and 27, and Bonin and Bailey's areas TF and TH.

Neuropsychological studies have shown that these three cortical regions contribute in an important way to normal memory function. We have investigated the topographic and laminar organization of the reciprocal projections between the entorhinal cortex and these two adjacent cortical areas by placing anterograde and retrograde tracers in all three regions. There were three major findings. First, the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices have distinct but partially overlapping interconnections with the entorhinal cortex. The perirhinal cortex tends to be interconnected with the rostral two-thirds of the entorhinal cortex while the parahippocampal cortex tends to be interconnected with approximately the caudal two-thirds of the entorhinal cortex. Second, the degree of reciprocity of the interconnections of the entorhinal cortex with the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices differs. The parahippocampal/entorhinal connections have a high degree of reciprocity. In contrast, the degree of reciprocity of the perirhinal/entorhinal interconnections varies depending on the mediolateral position within the perirhinal cortex; medial portions of the perirhinal cortex exhibit a higher degree of reciprocity with the entorhinal cortex than lateral portions. Third, the projections from the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices to the entorhinal cortex resemble a feedforward projection, while the projections from the entorhinal cortex to the perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices resemble a feedback projection pattern.},

Although the medial temporal lobe (which includes the hippocampus and surrounding perirhinal, parahippocampal, and entorhinal cortices) is known to be crucial for recognition memory, controversy remains regarding how the specific subregions within the medial temporal lobe contribute to recognition. We used event-related functional MRI to examine the relation between activation in distinct medial temporal lobe subregions during memory formation and the ability (i) to later recognize an item as previously encountered (item recognition) and (ii) to later recollect specific contextual details about the prior encounter (source recollection). Encoding activation in hippocampus and in posterior parahippocampal cortex predicted later source recollection, but was uncorrelated with item recognition. In contrast, encoding activation in perirhinal cortex predicted later item recognition, but not subsequent source recollection. These outcomes suggest that the subregions within the medial temporal lobe subserve distinct, but complementary, learning mechanisms.},

	abstract = {Anterograde and retrograde tracing methods including autoradiography, horseradish peroxidase histochemistry and fluorescent dye transport were used to demonstrate that the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex is connected with the hippocampal formation and associated cortical regions by two distinct pathways. Fibers forming a lateral pathway travel in the fronto-occipital fasciculus and connect the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex with the fundus of the rhinal sulcus, posterior subdivisions of the parahippocampal gyrus, and the presubiculum. A larger medial pathway forms in the cingulum bundle and terminates in the most caudal part of the presubiculum, as well as in adjacent transitional cortices. These cortices form a caudomedial promontory that is located between the posterior cingulate and prestriate areas. In all allo- and mesocortical targets of prefrontal cortex, labeled terminals form banding patterns reminiscent of the columnar organization of afferent fiber columns in neocortex. The same cytoarchitectonic areas that receive prefrontal afferents issue reciprocal projections. The largest source is the caudomedial lobule including its presubicular portion. Neurons in the para-hippocampal gyrus and adjacent presubiculum also are retrogradely labeled following implants of horseradish peroxidase or injection of fluorescent dyes into prefrontal cortex. In addition, subicular neurons project to the prefrontal cortex although the subiculum does not appear to receive prefrontal afferent input. These findings emphasize that multiple channels of communication link the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus via the parahippocampal gyrus, subiculum, presubiculum and adjacent transitional cortices. We speculate that each of these prefrontal projections may carry highly specific information into the hippocampus, whereas the reciprocal projections may allow retrieval by prefrontal cortex of memories stored in the hippocampus.},

	abstract = {Neuropsychological studies have recently demonstrated that the macaque monkey perirhinal (areas 35 and 36) and parahippocampal (areas TH and TF) cortices contribute importantly to normal memory function. Unfortunately, neuroanatomical information concerning the cytoarchitectonic organization and extrinsic connectivity of these cortical regions is meager. We investigated the organization of cortical inputs to the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices by placing discrete injections of the retrograde tracers fast blue, diamidino yellow, and wheat germ agglutinin conjugated to horseradish peroxidase throughout these areas. We found that the macaque monkey perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices receive different complements of cortical inputs. The major cortical inputs to the perirhinal cortex arise from the unimodal visual areas TE and rostral TEO and from area TF of the parahippocampal cortex. The perirhinal cortex also receives projections from the dysgranular and granular subdivisions of the insular cortex and from area 13 of the orbitofrontal cortex. In contrast, area TF of the parahippocampal cortex receives its strongest input from more caudal visual areas V4, TEO, and caudal TE, as well as prominent inputs from polymodal association cortices, including the retrosplenial cortex and the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus. Area TF also receives projections from areas 7a and LIP of the posterior parietal lobe, insular cortex, and areas 46, 13, 45, and 9 of the frontal lobe. As with area TF, area TH receives substantial projections from the retrosplenial cortex as well as moderate projections from the dorsal bank of the superior temporal sulcus; unlike area TF, area TH receives almost no innervation from areas TE and TEO. It does, however, receive relatively strong inputs from auditory association areas TE and TEO. It does, however, receive relatively strong inputs from auditory association areas on the convexity of the superior temporal gyrus. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

In this article, we review this literature and classify the types of ideas that have been put forward into three broad, somewhat overlapping classes: (1) learning of landmark location, stability and permanence; (2) integration between spatial reference frames; and (3) consolidation and retrieval of spatial knowledge (schemas). We evaluate these models and suggest ways to test them, before briefly discussing whether the spatial function may be a subset of a more general function in episodic memory.},

A series of neuroanatomical studies, motivated in part by the lesion studies, have shown that the macaque monkey entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices are polymodal association areas that each receive distinctive complements of cortical inputs. These areas also have extensive interconnections with other brain areas implicated in non-declarative forms of memory including the amygdala and striatum. This pattern of connections is consistent with the idea that the entorhinal, perirhinal and parahippocampal cortices may participate in a larger network of structures that integrates information across memory systems.},

	abstract = {In monkeys, bilateral damage to the medial temporal region produces severe memory impairment. This lesion, which includes the hippocampal formation, amygdala, and adjacent cortex, including the parahippocampal gyrus (the H+A+ lesion), appears to constitute an animal model of human medial temporal lobe amnesia. Reexamination of histological material from previously studied monkeys with H+A+ lesions indicated that the perirhinal cortex had also sustained significant damage. Furthermore, recent neuroanatomical studies show that the perirhinal cortex and the closely associated parahippocampal cortex provide the major source of cortical input to the hippocampal formation. Based on these 2 findings, we evaluated the severity of memory impairment in a group of monkeys that received bilateral lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex and parahippocampal gyrus (the PRPH lesion). The performance of the PRPH group was compared with that of monkeys with H+A+ lesions, who had been studied previously, and with a group of normal monkeys. Monkeys with PRPH lesions were severely impaired on 3 amnesia-sensitive tasks: delayed nonmatching to sample, object retention, and 8-pair concurrent discrimination. On pattern discrimination, a task analogous to ones that amnesic patients perform well, monkeys in the PRPH group performed normally. Overall, monkeys with PRPH lesions were as impaired or more impaired than the comparison group of monkeys with H+A+ lesions. These and other recent findings (Zola-Morgan et al., 1989b) suggest that the severe memory impairment in monkeys and humans associated with bilateral medial temporal lesions results from damage to the hippocampal formation and adjacent, anatomically related cortex, not from conjoint hippocampus-amygdala damage.},

Ablations of the perirhinal cortex alone produced a deficit nearly as severe as that found after rhinal cortex lesions, whereas ablations of the entorhinal cortex alone produced only a mild deficit. Contrary to the conclusion from an earlier study (Murray and Mishkin, 1986), the present results demonstrate not only that damage limited to the rhinal cortex is sufficient to produce a severe loss in visual recognition, but also that such damage leads to a far greater loss than damage to any other single structure in the medial part of the temporal lobe.},

Removal of the hippocampal formation plus rhinal cortex resulted in a mild recognition deficit, whereas removal of the amygdaloid complex plus rhinal cortex resulted in a severe deficit. Comparison of the results with those of an earlier study (Mishkin, 1978) indicates that adding a rhinal cortical removal to hippocampectomy yields little, if any, additional impairment in recognition. By contrast, adding a rhinal cortical removal to an amygdalectomy has a profound effect; indeed, the recognition impairment in monkeys with amygdaloid plus rhinal removals was at least as severe as that seen in monkeys with combined amygdaloid and hippocampal removals. Taken together, these results support the conclusion that combined damage to the amygdaloid and hippocampal systems is necessary to produce a severe recognition deficit. In addition, they suggest that the effect of ablating the rhinal cortex is equivalent to that of removing the entire hippocampal formation, presumably because the rhinal cortical ablation disconnects the hippocampus from its neocortical input.},

Relative to unoperated controls, monkeys with combined hippocampectomy and rhinal cortex ablation (H+Rh) were significantly impaired in visual recognition. 3. Comparison of the scores of the monkeys in the present H+Rh group, which sustained near-complete rhinal cortex damage, with the scores of monkeys in an earlier H+Rh group in which the rostral part of the rhinal cortex had been spared indicates that the magnitude of the impairment is greater in the group with the more complete rhinal cortex damage. This finding is consistent with the idea that the rhinal cortex is critical for visual recognition. 4. Comparison of the present results with those from an earlier study on visual recognition that employed lesions limited to the rhinal cortex (Rh group) shows, paradoxically, that adding removal of the hippocampal formation and parahippocampal gyrus to a rhinal cortex lesion significantly reduces the recognition impairment produced by rhinal cortex lesions alone. 5. Our findings do not fit the view that the hippocampal formation, parahippocampal gyrus, and rhinal cortex constitute parts of a single functional system, such that the greater the damage to the entire system, the more severe the impairment. Instead, the results are consistent with the view that there are multiple functional subdivisions within the medial temporal lobe.},

This system is comprised of the hippocampal region (i.e., the dentate gyrus, hippocampus proper and subicular complex) and the entorhinal, perirhinal, and parahippocampal cortices. While the hippocampal region has long been thought to be important in memory, there are few systematic studies in primates of the effects on memory of damage limited to the hippocampal region. We have used magnetic resonance imaging techniques, together with a stereotaxic approach, to produce bilateral lesions limited to the hippocampal region (the H lesion). Damage to the adjacent perirhinal, entorhinal, and parahippocampal cortex was minimal. Monkeys with the H lesion exhibited significant and long-lasting impairment on the delayed non-matching to sample task. At the same time, on this and other amnesia-sensitive tasks, monkeys with the H lesion performed better overall than monkeys with lesions of the hippocampal region that also included damage to the adjacent entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices (the H+ lesion). These findings show that, first, the hippocampal region itself is essential for normal memory function; and second, the adjacent entorhinal and parahippocampal cortices, either alone or in combination, are also an essential component of the medial temporal lobe memory system.},

Because these experiments used a common behavioral procedure, trial-unique visual delayed nonmatching-to-sample (DNMS), a quantitative synthesis (“meta-analysis”) was performed to determine whether hippocampal lesions produced a reliable net impairment in DNMS performance, and whether this impairment was related to the magnitude of hippocampal damage. A similar analysis was performed on data from monkeys with perirhinal or rhinal cortex damage (Meunier et al., J Neurosci 1993;13:5418–5432; Buffalo et al., Learn Mem 1999;6:572–599). DNMS performance scores were transformed to d′ values to permit comparisons across studies, and a loss in d′ score, a measure of the magnitude of the recognition deficit relative to the control group, was calculated for each operated monkey. Two main findings emerged. First, the loss in d′ following hippocampal damage was reliably larger than zero, but was smaller than that found after lesions limited to the perirhinal cortex. Second, the correlation of loss in d′ with extent of hippocampal damage was large and negative, indicating that greater impairments were associated with smaller hippocampal lesions. This relationship was opposite to that between loss in d′ and rhinal cortex damage, for which larger lesions were associated with greater impairment. These findings indicate that damage to the hippocampus and to the rhinal cortex affects recognition memory in different ways. Furthermore, they provide a framework for understanding the seemingly disparate effects of hippocampal damage on recognition memory in monkeys, and by extension, for interpreting the conflicting reports on the effects of such damage on recognition memory abilities in amnesic humans.

	abstract = {The claim that recognition memory is spared relative to recall after focal hippocampal damage has been disputed in the literature. We examined this claim by investigating object and object–location recall and recognition memory in a patient, YR, who has adult-onset selective hippocampal damage. Our aim was to identify the conditions under which recognition was spared relative to recall in this patient. She showed unimpaired forced-choice object recognition but clearly impaired recall, even when her control subjects found the object recognition task to be numerically harder than the object recall task. However, on two other recognition tests, YR's performance was not relatively spared. First, she was clearly impaired at an equivalently difficult yes/no object recognition task, but only when targets and foils were very similar. Second, YR was clearly impaired at forced-choice recognition of object–location associations. This impairment was also unrelated to difficulty because this task was no more difficult than the forced-choice object recognition task for control subjects. The clear impairment of yes/no, but not of forced-choice, object recognition after focal hippocampal damage, when targets and foils are very similar, is predicted by the neural network-based Complementary Learning Systems model of recognition. This model postulates that recognition is mediated by hippocampally dependent recollection and cortically dependent familiarity; thus hippocampal damage should not impair item familiarity. The model postulates that familiarity is ineffective when very similar targets and foils are shown one at a time and subjects have to identify which items are old (yes/no recognition). In contrast, familiarity is effective in discriminating which of similar targets and foils, seen together, is old (forced-choice recognition). Independent evidence from the remember/know procedure also indicates that YR's familiarity is normal. The Complementary Learning Systems model can also accommodate the clear impairment of forced-choice object–location recognition memory if it incorporates the view that the most complete convergence of spatial and object information, represented in different cortical regions, occurs in the hippocampus.

	abstract = {There is disagreement about whether selective hippocampal lesions in humans cause clear item recognition as well as recall deficits. Whereas Reed and Squire (Behav Neurosci 1997;111:667–775) found that patients with adult-onset relatively selective hippocampal lesions showed clear item recognition deficits, Vargha-Khadem et al. (Science 1997;277:376–380, Soc Neurosci Abstr 1998;24:1523) found that 3 patients who suffered selective hippocampal damage in early childhood showed clear recall deficits, but had relatively normal item recognition. Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495–499) argued, however, that item recognition may have been spared in these patients because the early onset of their pathology allowed compensatory mechanisms to develop. Therefore, to determine whether early lesion onset is critical for the relative sparing of item recognition and to determine whether its occurrence is influenced by task factors, we extensively examined item recognition in patient Y.R., who has pathology of adult-onset restricted to the hippocampus. Like the developmental cases, she showed clear free recall deficits on 34 tests, but her item recognition on 43 tests was relatively spared, and markedly less disrupted than her recall. Her item recognition performance relative to that of her controls was not significantly influenced by whether tests tapped visual or verbal materials, had a yes/no or forced-choice format, contained few or many items, had one or several foils per target item, used short or very long delays, or were difficult or easy for normal subjects. Interestingly, YR's bilateral hippocampal destruction was greater than at least 2 of the 3 patients of Manns and Squire (Hippocampus 1999;9:495–499). The possible reasons why item recognition differs across patients with relatively selective hippocampal damage of adult-onset and how the reasons that are truly critical can be best identified are discussed.

	abstract = {The formation of new associations between items is critical for establishing episodic memories. It has been suggested that the hippocampus is essential for creating such associations but is not involved, or is much less involved, in memory for single items. In Experiment 1, we tested controls and amnesic patients with bilateral lesions thought to be limited primarily to the hippocampal region in both single-item and associative recognition memory tasks. In the single-item task, a conventional recognition memory task was administered in which participants studied either houses or faces and were tested for their ability to recognize the individual items. In the associative task, participants studied paired pictures of houses and faces with instructions that encouraged associating the two stimuli, and were tested for their ability to recognize the specific pairings that were presented at study. Like the controls, the amnesic patients performed more poorly on the associative task. Relative to the controls, the amnesic patients were impaired to a similar extent on the single-item and associative tasks. In Experiment 2, the performance of the amnesic patients was improved by increasing the number of presentations of the study lists (eight presentations instead of one). On both the single-item and associative tests, the performance of the amnesic patients after eight presentations was now identical to the performance of the controls who had been given only one presentation of the study list. Thus, the associative condition was not disproportionally difficult for the amnesic patients. These results are consistent with the idea that the hippocampus is similarly involved in single-item and associative memory.},

One of the most widely studied examples of declarative memory is the capacity to recognize recently encountered material as familiar, but uncertainty remains about whether intact recognition memory depends on the hippocampal region itself and, if so, what the nature of the hippocampal contribution might be. Seven patients with bilateral damage thought to be limited primarily to the hippocampal region were impaired on three standard tests of recognition memory. In addition, the patients were impaired to a similar extent at Remembering and Knowing, measures of the two processes thought to support recognition performance: the ability to remember the learning episode (episodic recollection) and the capacity for judging items as familiar (familiarity).},

The Denman Memory Scale was given to all subjects as a baseline memory assessment. All subjects were then tested for item and order recognition memory for lists of six words, pictures, abstract pictures, spatial locations, and motor responses. Results indicated that hypoxic subjects are impaired compared to control subjects on the Denman memory scale for verbal, non-verbal, and full-scale memory quotients. In addition, results indicated that compared to control subjects, hypoxic subjects displayed item and order recognition deficits for words, pictures, abstract pictures, and spatial locations. A recency effect for item recognition of abstract pictures, spatial locations, and hand positions was found. For motor response order recognition, both primacy and recency effects were found, with deficits in performance for the middle items of the list. It appears that subjects with hypoxic brain injury in the face of severe memory deficits for words, pictures, abstract pictures, and spatial locations display residual capacity for remembering the last items for spatial locations, abstract designs, and hand positions. Hypoxic subjects also display residual capacity for remembering motor responses using episodic or data-based memory.},

These findings have surprised scientists and clinicians because they challenge decades of established thinking that the parietal lobe does not support memory function. However, direct empirical investigation of whether circumscribed parietal lobe lesions might indeed be associated with human memory impairment has been lacking. Here we confirm using functional magnetic resonance imaging that significant parietal lobe activation is observed in healthy volunteers during a task assessing recollection of the context in which events previously occurred. However, patients with parietal lobe lesions that overlap closely with the regions activated in the healthy volunteers nevertheless exhibit normal performance on the same recollection task. Thus, although the processes subserved by the human parietal lobe appear to be recruited to support memory function, they are not a necessary requirement for accurate remembering to occur.},

We found that regions early in the hippocampal circuit (dentate gyrus and CA fields 2 and 3) were selectively active during episodic memory formation, whereas a region later in the circuit (the subiculum) was active during the recollection of the learning episode.

This suggests the necessity of recurrent processing in these computations. Which brain circuits are responsible for computing and transmitting these putative recurrent signals to IT? To test whether the ventrolateral prefrontal cortex (vlPFC) is a critical recurrent node in this system, here, we pharmacologically inactivated parts of vlPFC and simultaneously measured IT activity while monkeys performed object discrimination tasks. vlPFC inactivation deteriorated the quality of late-phase ({\textgreater}150 ms from image onset) IT population code and produced commensurate behavioral deficits for late-solved images. Finally, silencing vlPFC caused the monkeys’ IT activity and behavior to become more like those produced by feedforward-only ventral stream models. Together with prior work, these results implicate fast recurrent processing through vlPFC as critical to producing behaviorally sufficient object representations in IT.},

Here we first used behavioral methods to discover hundreds of these ‘challenge’ images. Second, using large-scale electrophysiology, we observed that behaviorally sufficient object identity solutions emerged {\textasciitilde}30 ms later in the IT cortex for challenge images compared with primate performance-matched ‘control’ images. Third, these behaviorally critical late-phase IT response patterns were poorly predicted by feedforward deep CNN activations. Notably, very-deep CNNs and shallower recurrent CNNs better predicted these late IT responses, suggesting that there is a functional equivalence between additional nonlinear transformations and recurrence. Beyond arguing that recurrent circuits are critical for rapid object identification, our results provide strong constraints for future recurrent model development.},

Here we ask to what extent the communication between the prefrontal cortex and LEC is critically involved in the processing of episodic-like memory. We applied a disconnection procedure to test whether the interaction between the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC) and LEC is essential for the expression of recognition memory. It was found that male rats that received unilateral NMDA lesions of the mPFC and LEC in the same hemisphere, exhibited intact episodic-like (what-where-when) and object-recognition memories. When these lesions were placed in the opposite hemispheres (disconnection), episodic-like and associative memories for object identity, location and context were impaired. However, the disconnection did not impair the components of episodic memory, namely memory for novel object (what), object place (where) and temporal order (when), per se. Thus, the present findings suggest that the mPFC and LEC are a critical part of a neural circuit that underlies episodic-like and associative object-recognition memory. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.},

Whereas most previous studies focused on aversive conditioning in the amygdala and the hippocampus, here we examine the role of the ventromedial prefrontal cortex (vmPFC) in consolidation and reconsolidation of object recognition memory. Object recognition memory is the ability to discriminate the familiarity of previously encountered objects. We found that microinfusion of the protein synthesis inhibitor anisomycin or the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist D,L-2-amino-5-phosphonovaleric acid (APV) into the vmPFC, immediately after training, resulted in impairment of long-term (24 h) but not short-term (3 h) recognition memory. Similarly, microinfusion of anisomycin or APV into the vmPFC immediately after reactivation of the long-term memory impaired recognition memory 24 h, but not 3 h, post-reactivation. These results indicate that both protein synthesis and NMDA receptors are required for consolidation and reconsolidation of recognition memory in the vmPFC.},

Recently, the role of the IC has been highlighted by findings involving the IC in non-taste memory formation in both human and animal studies. Recognition memory is based on the ability to assess the familiarity of a previously encountered stimulus, and it is considered a form of declarative memory. In this work, I am proposing that the IC and its related circuitry are highly involved in the conversion of novel to familiar stimulus for both object and taste recognition memory. In addition, I will review some of the molecular mechanisms involved in the modification of novelty to familiarity memory processes, including the role of epigenetic mechanisms on the consolidation of recognition memory within the IC. In the second part of the paper, I will review some of the possible mechanisms to transform a novel taste into a familiar aversive taste by a functional interaction between the IC and the amygdala. In summary, the IC is an important area that will open a new avenue for the study of the mechanisms involved in the neurobiology of learning and memory in the near future.},
