# Week 14 (Janurary 23th, 2023)

## goals for this time frame
- Finally get all the preprocessed data
- Reorganize the file structure
- Finish the glm for one participant, at least for one run. 


## work conducted for this time frame
- Finished moving files into a BIDS structure
- I now have most of the data preprocessed, last week I barely had 3 participants with full data, now its almost 10x!
- Progressed the glm but underestimated the amount of steps required to finish this. Need to do more.
