# Week 14 (Feburary 27th, 2023)

## goals for this time frame
- Get the z-maps for all runs for all participants that have their full data preprocessed
- Start the jupyter-book. 


## work conducted for this time frame
- I managed to get all the z-maps, although this did lead to several crashes of the notebook. In the end one solution was to change some device settings and close everything else.


## problems encountered during this time frame
- Several memory issues occured. I cannot run multiple participants in quick succession.
