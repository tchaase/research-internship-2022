# Week 6 (November 28th, 2022)

**goals for this time frame**
- Attempt various other ways to preprocess the data.

**work conducted for this time frame**
- Someone aided in getting preprocessing done via `brainlife`.
- Data exploration was continued. 

**problems encountered during this time frame**
- Preprocessing still does not work and I do not know why. 
- For data exploration one line of code that is supposed to give me an overview over the runs required loading of all the data - why is that?
