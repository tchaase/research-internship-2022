# Week 2 (November 1, 2022)

**goals for this time frame**
- Get prepreprocessing done.
- Work on concrete hypotheses.

**work conducted for this time frame**
- Set up the project.

**problems encountered during this time frame**
- Data set has object files that aren't continously numbered - why? 
    - Reason: There are two types of tasks!  
- Data has multi-run data. Need to figure out which pipeline can work with this. Can fMRI prep do this? <- do next week

**notes**
- Functional MRIQC - brain life is missing this. Contact brain life on the functional processsing pipeline. Why is there no functional quality control?
    - Even MRIQC on my structural data doesn't work. Why is that?
