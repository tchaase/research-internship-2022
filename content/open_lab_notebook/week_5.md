**goals for this time frame**
- Figure out the preprocessing steps.
- Document the preprocessing attempts better. 

**work conducted for this time frame**
- Preprocessing in various ways was attempted. 
- The documentation now also includes the failed attempts and the respective error logs. 

**problems encountered during this time frame**
- Issues with preprocessing may be related to memory issues. I made various attempts to solve those issues, but they failed. These include changing `docker arguments` to increase the available memory etc.
