# Week 17-18 (February 13th, 2023)

**goals for this time frame**
- Get a loop that estimates the glm for all participants for the task "scene".


**work conducted for this time frame**
- Created the loop, tried to work around various errors to make the loop work.


**problems encountered during this time frame**
- Several memory issues occured. I cannot run multiple participants in quick succession. Therefore, one main goal in the next time frame will be writing the same code without a loop and with several steps, to ensure that my device has enough memory.
