# Week 2 (November 1 2022)

## goals for this time frame
- get prepreprocessing done
- concrete hypotheses need to be worked on

## work conducted for this time frame
- set up the project

## problems encountered during this time frame
- data set has object files that aren't continously numbered - why?
- data has multi-run data. Need to figure out which pipeline can work with this. Can fMRI prep do this? <- do next week

## notes
- functional MRIQC - brain life is missing this. Contact brain life on the functional processsing pipeline. Why is there no functional quality control.
    - Even MRIQC on my structural data doesn't work. Why is that?
